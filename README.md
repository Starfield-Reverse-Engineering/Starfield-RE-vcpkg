### Including CommonLibSF in your project

CommonLibSF is available as a vcpkg port. To add it to your project,

1. Create a `vcpkg-configuration.json` file in your project root (next to `vcpkg.json`) with the following OR append to your existing `vcpkg.json`:

```json
{
  "default-registry": {
    "kind": "git",
    "repository": "https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg",
    "baseline": "7a6f366cefd27210f6a8309aed10c31104436509"
  },
  "registries": [
    {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/Starfield-Reverse-Engineering/Starfield-RE-vcpkg",
      "baseline": "b724c4585ff8ee65dcbfd40bb9ea62fc523af7c2",
      "packages": ["commonlibsf"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Add CommonLibSF to the `"dependencies"` key in `vcpkg.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["commonlibsf"]
}
```

3. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(CommonLibSF CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_commonlibsf_plugin(
  ${PROJECT_NAME}
  AUTHOR AuthorName
  SOURCES ${headers} ${sources}
)
```
